## Description
this project is a game known as hangman where the words to which the user needs to guess are already stored. the user needs to guess each individual letter for that word. if the letter chosen is good the user maintains his life and the letter shows up on the screen. If the user is incorrect he/she will lose a life and the letter will not show up. In order to win every letter needs to be seen on the program view before he/she uses up all the lives. Also the program has different difficulties that the user can choose upon and also allow the user to restart the program or end the program.
